                <p className='text-sm sm:text-md'>
                    The e-commerce industry often falls into the high-risk category, making it difficult to access stable and reliable payment solutions. Banks and traditional processors usually hesitate due to card-not-present transactions, higher fraud potential, and fluctuating online order volumes. At Crazy Merchants, we offer tailored merchant services for e-commerce businesses, giving you secure payment processing, higher approval rates, and a system built to support the dynamic nature of online operations.
