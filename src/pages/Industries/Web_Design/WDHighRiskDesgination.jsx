                    SEO agencies can be considered high-risk because their results are often subjective, which may lead to disputes or chargebacks. Even if the agency is trustworthy, it can still be tricky for them to gain confidence from payment processors due to the long service timelines and varying outcomes. Since many SEO services involve recurring, high-dollar payments, some processors may be cautious, especially when stored credit card information is used for monthly billing. Being labeled as a high-risk merchant necessitates partnering with a payment processor experienced in high-risk accounts. Avoid disruptions by choosing Crazy Merchant, a leader in high-risk merchant account solutions for the web design and SEO industry.
